# Donations

Just like any other __Open-Source__ project, we depend on the communities support to keep the vision, goals and objectives alive. 

__Where do the donations go?__

Much of the donations are directed towards: 

- hosting services for web based platforms
- payment for ArcGIS software license
- 3rd Party package payments
