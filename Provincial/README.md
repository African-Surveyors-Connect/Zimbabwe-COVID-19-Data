# COVID-19 Zimbabwe Data Cases By Province (Deprecated)
 This is the data repository for the  Novel Coronavirus Visual Dashboard operated by African Surveyors Connect and is based on daily updates for the Republic of Zimbabwe. 

 <strong>For Provincial Records, kidnyl refer to this new <a href="">Provincial Time Series</a> data which is a cumulation of all the daily cases as they are updated in our database systems. 

 ### About Data

<br>
We update this repository every evening before 00.00 (GMT +02.00). Some delays might occur from time to time due to unforseen circumstances hence the latest time to check and receive an update on the recent updates will be at 10.00 (GMT +02.00) of the following day.
